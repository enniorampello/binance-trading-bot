# BinanceTradingBot

### Introduction
This is a cryptocurrency trading bot built to work on binance exchange. 
The main goal of this bot is to **trade automatically on Binance**, and, for doing so, it is necessary to have a [Binance account](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register) and to configure **Binance API keys**.

### Libraries
This bot is developed in Python 3.8 and it's currently based on **these libraries**:
- [`pandas`](https://www.learndatasci.com/tutorials/python-pandas-tutorial-complete-introduction-for-beginners/)
- [`python-binance`](https://python-binance.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html)
- [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html)

`python-binance` is currently **fundamental** for the development of the algorithm, since it is used as a **wrapper for the Binance API**. 
It is possible, in future, to consider using directly the Binance API through requests made using the [`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/projects/it/it/latest/) library.
